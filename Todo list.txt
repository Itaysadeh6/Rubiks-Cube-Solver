General:
    see how much of Thisthlewaite's algorithm is relevant to the improved 2 phase version and try to implement it (?)

    make Indexer more generic
    
    make a untility class / lib for searchers

    make a rotateAdjacents CW and CCW and store the affected facelets in a simple list or a macro

    threading for loading the databases & generating databases & solving

    remove the option to not use databases depends on the time it takes to generate tables
    
    advanced move pruning with respect to 3 moves in reverse
    
    check if restricting moves (no prime moves) speeds the search and or the generation of tables

Cube.cpp:
    displayCube() find a more readable way of doing that

Engine.cpp:
    remove IDs for facelets functonality
